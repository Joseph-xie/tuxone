This is a brief description of the TUXEDO stockapp Application.
A more comprehensive look can be found in the TUXEDO System
Application Development Guide.

The stockapp Application consists of 2 servers offering the same 
STOCKQUOTE service. The client is run with
a single argument, which is an xml file. 
The client calls the service, which returns the stock price.
The client then prints the xml buffer.

Example: Client stock_quote_beas.xml 

Returns: xml buffer with the stock price for BEAS or MSFT. 

This application runs 2 servers on a single machine. This example also 
illustrates ROUTING of XML buffers - that's why the need for two servers.
One of the servers is a Tuxedo server written in C++ and the other one is
written in C. The Tuxedo serve written in C requires a wrapper dll to call 
the C++ methods in the xerces parser.


You should probably copy the stockapp files to your own directory,
since the configuration file must be edited and you might also
want to experiment with the client and server code.

You need to set and export several environment variables before using
TUXEDO or running any TUXEDO application:

	TUXDIR - base directory of the TUXEDO software
	PATH - must include %TUXDIR%/bin
	TUXCONFIG - full pathname of binary tuxconfig file


The sample configuration file, ubbsimple, must be edited to replace
the bracketed items with values appropriate to your installation.
Your TUXDIR and TUXCONFIG environment variables must match the
values in the configuration file.

After editing ubbsimple, create the binary TUXCONFIG file with the command:

	tmloadcf ubbsimple
	(Answer "y" if it asks you whether it should proceed)

To build the client and the servers,
        export CFLAGS=-I.

	buildclient -o Client -f Client.cpp -f SAXPrint.cpp -f SAXPrintHandlers.cpp -f %TUXDIR%\lib\libtxml.lib

	buildserver -o stockxml -f stockxml.cpp -f DOMTreeErrorReporter.cpp -s STOCKQUOTE -f %TUXDIR%\lib\libtxml.lib

        buildserver -v -s STOCKQUOTE -f stockxml_c.c -o stockxml_c -f xmlWrapper.cpp -f DOMTreeErrorReporter.cpp -f %TUXDIR%\lib\libtxml.lib

The stockapp Application can be booted with the command:

	tmboot -y

Then you can run the client as shown in the example above.

When you are done, you can shut down the Simple Application with
the command:

	tmshutdown -y
