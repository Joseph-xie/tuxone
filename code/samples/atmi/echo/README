You need to set and export several environment variables before using
TUXONE or running any TUXONE application:

The sample script file int tuxone dir, tux.env, must be edited to replace
the bracketed items with values appropriate to your installation.

After editing tux.env, running the command:
	. ./tux.env

If you have the TUXONE Development Environment, you can also build them yourself:

	buildclient -o client -f client.c
	buildserver -o server -f server.c -s ECHO

The Simple Application can be booted with the command:

	./txgate
	./server
	./client

Then you can run "echo" as shown in the example above.

When you are done, you can shut down the TUXONE System Application with
the command:

	tmshutdown -y
